            <p>
              Unmail requires read-only access to your Gmail account via OAuth. We fetch email metadata and content strictly based on your applied filters (read/unread status, lookback days, importance, and starred status). Unmail's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

            <p>
              Mails fetched to your local device are encrypted entirely within your browser utilizing AES-GCM standards. The cryptographic key is derived directly from your user ID and email address. This ensures that the raw fetched data at rest in your local environment cannot be read by any external party.

            <p>
              When you actively select emails for analysis, only the specific subset of emails you choose is transmitted to our AI processing providers. This data is strictly utilized to generate derived insights and categorization options based on the payload. It is not used to train global AI models.

            <p>
              You may explicitly opt to sync analyzed emails to the Unmail Postgres cloud database. All synchronized data is subjected to robust server-side encryption prior to persistence. We do not aggregate, sell, or distribute your cloud vault data to third-party brokers.

            <p>
              Local vault data can be cleared at any time by clearing your browser storage. Cloud vault data can be managed or permanently deleted through your account settings. Revoking OAuth access directly via your Google Account will instantly sever Unmail's ability to fetch new data.
